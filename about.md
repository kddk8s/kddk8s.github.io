I'm just an old autistic polygender trans tomboy with a karaoke problem.

My highlights... sent the newgroup message that moved the online trans community from a couple private mailing lists and an IRC channel to USENET.  USENET as a discussion forum platform is long dead.

I onboarded the folks that had to do the Root Cause Analysis of the incident behind [IBM Commercial - I'm Stupid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38MS4sdK-4Y) ... [Victoria's Secret knows ads, but not the Web](http://edition.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9902/05/vicweb.idg/)
