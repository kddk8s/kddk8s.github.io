I'm no authority... I have been around the block a few times.  A few things for our queer community.

* [That's Gender Dysphoria, FYI](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en) (Or let's crack a few eggs)
* [Guidelines for the Primary and Gender-Affirming Care of transgender and Gender Nonbinary People](https://transcare.ucsf.edu/guidelines) (Or if you thought your endo was winging it... it's probably this or small tweaks on this)
* [World Professional Association for Transgender Health Standards of Care 8](https://www.wpath.org/soc8/chapters) (Or HBIGDA was a pile of misogynistic, homophobic, transphobic cruelty.  And it's a damn shame it took the brand of an endocrinologist that gave a damn.)
* [Foot Note][foot-note]
